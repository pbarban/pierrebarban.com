title: Intention of this blog
---

My name is Pierre Barban. Freshly graduated from two masters' mainly focusing on environmental economics, I am currently a data analyst at Eco-Counter in Montr√©al, Canada. My amazing job gives me the opportunity to support cities, national parks, and other governmental institutions to enhance their pedestrian and bicycle counts data.
At the moment I am creating this blog, I intent to share stories mostly covering sustainable topics supported by data analysis. I am also planning on analyzing interesting data sets that I might come upon in my daily life. At the border of academics and story-telling, I hope to write comprehensive posts with the scientific rigour that I have learned throughout my young research career. Unless specified, all my data analysis are down with the programming language R. All constructive feedback are more than welcome.
