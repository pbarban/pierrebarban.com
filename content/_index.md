My name is Pierre Barban. Data Scientist in bike data, I am passionate about the idea of recording flows of cyclists in cities around the world. 

I intent to share stories mostly covering topics related to sustainability supported by data analytics. At the border of academics and story-telling, I hope to write comprehensive posts with the scientific rigour that I have learned throughout my young research career. Unless specified, all my data analysis done with the programming language R. All constructive feedback are more than welcome.
