My name is Pierre Barban. I am a data analyst currently located in Montr√©al, Canada. My amazing job gives me the opportunity to assist cities, national parks, and other governmental institutions to enhance their pedestrian and bicycle counting data.
I intent to share stories mostly covering topics related to sustainability supported by data analytics. At the border of academics and story-telling, I hope to write comprehensive posts with the scientific rigour that I have learned throughout my young research career. Unless specified, all my data analysis done with the programming language R. All constructive feedbacks are more than welcome.
