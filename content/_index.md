My name is Pierre Barban. I am a data analyst at Eco-Counter in Montr√©al, Canada. My amazing job gives me the opportunity to support cities, national parks, and other governmental institutions to enhance their pedestrian and bicycle counts data.
At the moment I am creating this blog, I intent to share stories mostly covering sustainable topics supported by data analysis. At the border of academics and story-telling, I hope to write comprehensive posts with the scientific rigour that I have learned throughout my young research career. Unless specified, all my data analysis are written down with the programming language R. All constructive feedback are more than welcome.
